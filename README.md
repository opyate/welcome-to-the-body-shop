Good morning, interviewers. I had a quick look at the HMRC Github. Hello Andy (Hicks)! Long time no see (Scala meetup). I think last time was at ThoughtWorks doing a Scala pairing exercise at ThoughtWorks on jr0cket's laptop, and he helpfully had Vim, Emacs AND a Java IDE installed.

Anyhoo, let's get started.

I used to use Giter8 for starting new projects, but don't have it handy right now. And SBT still doesn't have a `new project` command (!)

Already 8 minutes spent, and all I've done is set up the project. This isn't going to go well.
