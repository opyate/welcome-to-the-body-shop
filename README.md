Good morning, interviewers. I had a quick look at the HMRC Github. Hello Andy (Hicks)! Long time no see (Scala meetup). I think last time was at ThoughtWorks doing a Scala pairing exercise at ThoughtWorks on jr0cket's laptop, and he helpfully had Vim, Emacs AND a Java IDE installed.

Anyhoo, let's get started.

I used to use Giter8 for starting new projects, but don't have it handy right now. And SBT still doesn't have a `new project` command (!)

Already 8 minutes spent, and all I've done is set up the project. This isn't going to go well.

Oh, dear. 17 minutes for the first cart. That's because SBT took its sweet time downloading the doctest thing. (I like tests small, which means they can fit nicely in the Javadoc)

Here's a nice quote: “I think it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing” - Alan J. Perlis

In about 4 minutes I would have reached time, and I didn't even make it easy for you to run this on the CLI.

Damn SBT and its slow start-up times!

Anyhoo, `sbt test` runs the tests, and I think you'll agree that it works.

A few notes, though: I have an unfair advantage in that I've worked extensively in ecommerce (it's called "promotions", not "offers", BTW) and I have also once been given this test at a bank in Canary Wharf, albeit in Java.
